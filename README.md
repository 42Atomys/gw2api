# gw2api-go

A Go Wrapper to your GuildWars 2 Go Project

### What's is GW2-API 

At the start GW2-API as created to be a wrapper of the GuildWars2 Official API.
After few months of use in private projects, I decide to make it public and rewrite the library.

GW2-API is a complete and up-to-date wrapper in Golang.
